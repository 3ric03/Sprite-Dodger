# Sprite-Dodger
My friend and I made two python games via PyGame, and implemented it into one application called GuiForSummative.py.
Inside there are two games, Sprite Dodger, which I coded, and Space Invaders, which my friend did.
The standalone code/application for Sprite Dodgers is avaliable as Summative.py.<br >
To make sprite dodgers, I used the pygame libary, math functions, as well as file I/O to score high scores.
